  Work on transformers-mblt Hugging Face Transformers integrations for Mobilint NPUs: model and
  config classes, NPU backend wiring, caches, generation and EAGLE-3, the TPS/passthrough CLI,
  tests, and benchmarks, while preserving Hub proxy and Model Zoo compatibility contracts.

# transformers-mblt

## Start Here

1. Read `AGENTS.md`.
2. Run `git status --short` before changing files.
3. Read `pyproject.toml`, `tests/TEST.md`, `transformers_mblt/README.md`, and, for benchmark
   work, `benchmark/transformers/README.md`.
4. For behavior questions, compare against `../mblt-model-zoo` at `origin/master`
   (`mblt_model_zoo/hf_transformers`). Until the Model Zoo facade lands, it is the reference.

## Package Layout

- `transformers_mblt/models/<arch>/`: `configuration_*`, `modeling_*`, optional `processing_*`,
  and the Hub `proxy_*` module. The `configuration_*`, `modeling_*`, and `processing_*` modules
  register with the Auto classes at import time.
- `transformers_mblt/utils/`: shared mixins (`configuration_utils`, `modeling_utils`,
  `generation_utils`, `base_utils`), caches (`cache_utils`), `multi_slot_dispatch`, `eagle3/`,
  benchmark helpers, and `api.list_models` / `list_tasks`.
- `transformers_mblt/_npu.py`: `mblt_npu` backend re-export plus the `dispatcher` property.
- `transformers_mblt/_registry.py`: `register()` for loading without remote code.
- `transformers_mblt/cli/`: `main` (`transformers-mblt`), `list`, `tps`, `tps_table`, `chat`, and
  `transformers_compat` (upstream passthrough).

## Hub Proxy and Registration

- A new architecture needs these changes together:
  - `configuration_*`, `modeling_*`, and optional `processing_*` modules with Auto registration
  - a `proxy_*` module that uses the `transformers_mblt` → `mblt_model_zoo.hf_transformers`
    fallback pattern
  - an entry in `_registry._ARCHITECTURES`
  - a row in the README task table
  - a test case
- Never rename a `mobilint-*` `model_type` or a `Mobilint*` class that a published `config.json`
  or `auto_map` references.
- Do not upload proxies or configs to the Hub without explicit approval.
  `benchmark/transformers/update_npu_prefill_chunk_size_configs.py` writes to the Hub; run it
  only on request.

## Preserve Contracts

- The supported package range is `transformers>=4.54.0,<5.18.0`; Transformers 5.17 is the
  latest release line covered by the compatibility matrix. Newer releases require explicit
  compatibility validation before they are added to the package range.
- `MobilintNPUBackend` hosts `N` `qbruntime.Model` slots; `max_batch_size` is the aggregate batch
  capacity `N * K`, where `K` is the compiled MXQ batch axis probed from slot 0. The backend
  launches `N = ceil(max_batch_size / K)` slots and distributes them round-robin across the
  unique devices referenced by the canonical target strings. A non-batch MXQ (`K == 1`) with
  logical `B > 1` fans into `N = B` slots dispatched in parallel via
  `MobilintNPUBackend.infer_slot`; a batched MXQ (`K > 1`) reuses hardware batching until
  `N * K >= max_batch_size`. Beam search paths stay `N = 1`.
- `dev_no` is syntactic sugar for the device-prefix component of the canonical target strings.
  Scalar pins one device, a list expands to multiple devices. Read the canonical target lists
  (`_target_cores_serialized` / `_target_clusters_serialized`, or the public accessors) at
  dispatch time so multi-device backends behave correctly.
- Backend target topology accumulates raw overrides in `NPUTargetSpecPending` on
  `MobilintNPUBackend._pending`; the lazy `_spec` property calls `pending.finalize()` once per
  epoch and caches on `self._finalized`. After each finalize, `_pending` is promoted to a fresh
  baseline via `NPUTargetSpecPending.from_baseline` (all intent flags cleared) so the next HF
  setter chain or standalone runtime mutation gets an isolated intent slate. The per-field
  setters (`dev_no`, `core_mode`, `target_cores`, `target_clusters`) only mutate `_pending` and
  invalidate `_finalized`; setter order within one chain does not affect the resolved canonical
  spec. `finalize()` runs one ordered pipeline (legacy migration → sibling drop → grain
  unification → off-mode drop → device-set consistency → `global8` coverage) once every
  accumulated override is visible. Target-only override syncs `dev_no` to the target device
  set at finalize; `dev_no`-only override clears stale targets and re-expands sugar; both
  overridden → the device-set consistency check surfaces mismatches on the next canonical read
  (not on the setter). `NPUTargetSpec.from_kwargs` remains the config-layer (JSON load) entry
  point where eager normalization is unambiguous.
- Canonical NPU target wire form is fully-qualified: `target_cores` entries are `"d:c:k"`
  strings and `target_clusters` entries are `"d:c"` strings. Legacy 2-part `c:k` cores, bare
  integer clusters, and `qbruntime.CoreId` / `Cluster` objects are silently migrated to the
  canonical form inside `finalize()` (and its `_normalize_npu_target_kwargs` config-
  layer wrapper) using `dev_no` as the fallback prefix. `single` mode unfolds `target_clusters`
  into every cluster core; `multi` / `global4` / `global8` fold `target_cores` up to their
  `"d:c"` cluster prefixes and warn when a partial cluster is rounded up. `global8` requires
  both clusters on every covered device.
- `MobilintCache([m0, m1, ...], per_model_batch=K)` dualizes KV state along
  `(model_idx, cache_id)` with capacity `N * K` rows. Row `i` maps to `(i // K, i % K)`; use
  `slot_of`, `model_of`, and `group_by_model` for dispatch routing. `ensure_batch_size` beyond
  `N * K` is only allowed on the legacy single-Model hardware-batch path (`N == 1`).
  `MobilintCache(model, batch_size=K)` remains as a shim for the historical `N = 1, K = K`
  case; do not pass both `per_model_batch` and `batch_size` in the same call.
- `MobilintBeamCache` enforces `N == 1` — beam search bookkeeping tracks one active qbruntime
  cache and multi-Model construction raises `NotImplementedError`. Use `MobilintCache` for
  multi-Model dispatch.
- On HBM `BadAlloc` during `create` or `launch`, `MobilintNPUBackend` disposes every previously
  loaded slot and re-raises the underlying `QbRuntimeError` as `MobilintBackendAllocError` with
  `phase`, `slot`, `dev`, `succeeded_so_far`, `n_total`, `max_batch_size`, and `k_per_model`
  context. Callers should lower `max_batch_size` or spread the workload across more devices via
  `dev_no` (or explicit fully-qualified target strings) rather than retrying on the same
  target set.
- Reuse shared NPU options and ``tests/npu_backend_options.py` builders` rather
  than introducing divergent hardware flags or engine keyword bundles.
- Treat `transformers_mblt/cli/tps_table.py` as the source of truth for TPS printed rows, JSON keys,
  units, and run/aggregate/summary extraction. Update the focused `tests/transformers/cli_tps`
  schema and layer-consistency tests with any change.
- Keep VLM non-batch tests under `tests/transformers/image_text_to_text/non_batch`. Keep batch
  text-generation and image-text-to-text suites in their `batch` directories and route both
  through serial Phase B in `scripts/test_transformers_matrix.py`.
- Qwen3-VL release contract: `MobilintQwen3VLConfig.is_dynamic` (with the `dynamic_vision`
  compatibility alias) pairs the vision MXQ, text
  MXQ, and processor. Dynamic releases accept video and per-prompt multi-image; static releases
  reject both with `NotImplementedError`. Batched single-image prompts are always allowed.
  `sync_dynamic_vision_from_model()` is only needed when a runtime `vision_mxq_path=` override
  diverges from the shipped config. Full contract, override flow, and `vision_output_order`
  handling (including `MBLT_VISION_OUTPUT_ORDER` env override) live in
  `transformers_mblt/README.md`; per-artifact resolution and validation logic
  live in `transformers_mblt/models/qwen3_vl/modeling_qwen3_vl.py::_resolve_vision_output_order`.
- Preserve local style in `transformers_mblt/models` and `transformers_mblt/utils`; they are
  excluded from repository-wide Ruff checks.

## EAGLE-3 Workflow

- Load a release (for example `mobilint/EAGLE3-Qwen3-4B`) through
  `AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(...)`; the wrapper binds the base MXQ, one-block draft
  MXQ, and FC stack as a single release. Qwen3 and Llama base families are supported through
  `transformers_mblt/models/qwen3_eagle3/` and
  `transformers_mblt/models/llama_eagle3/`. Each ships a
  `MobilintXxxEagle3Config` / `MobilintXxxEagle3ForCausalLM` pair
  (`MobilintQwen3Eagle3Config` / `MobilintQwen3Eagle3ForCausalLM`,
  `MobilintLlamaEagle3Config` / `MobilintLlamaEagle3ForCausalLM`) that wires
  `MobilintEagle3FCProjector`, the family-specific base backend, and the family-specific
  one-block draft backend on top of the shared `MobilintEagle3BaseModelMixin` /
  `MobilintEagle3DraftModelMixin`. The mixins own `embed_tokens` and `rotary_emb`
  initialization, so every concrete `MobilintXxxEagle3ForCausalLM.__init__` stays a thin
  wiring shim; register a new base family by subclassing the mixins rather than duplicating
  the init bodies. The presence of `eagle3_base_model` on the loaded model is how measurement
  paths detect EAGLE-3.
- Tune the draft-tree budget through `GenerationConfig.num_assistant_tokens` (default `64` in
  `transformers_mblt/utils/generation_utils.py`). Qwen3-4B measures best in the
  `25`–`30` range: the Hugging Face default of `49` costs more iteration latency than its extra
  acceptance recovers. Override by editing the shipped `generation_config.json`, by setting
  `model.generation_config.num_assistant_tokens = ...` before `generate`, or by passing
  `num_assistant_tokens=<value>` directly to `generate(...)` for a per-call override.
- The tree shape lives in `generation_config.json` too: `eagle3_tree_depth` (expansion steps) and
  `eagle3_tree_top_k` (fan-out per level), resolved per `generate` call with the same override
  paths. The same-named `config.json` fields are a legacy fallback for older releases. Tune all
  three per target body and core mode with `transformers-mblt tps measure --eagle3-tree-depth
  --eagle3-tree-top-k --num-assistant-tokens`; NPU verify cost grows with the verified token
  count, so the NPU optimum is a much smaller tree than GPU EAGLE-3 defaults.
- Mobilint EAGLE-3 releases train base and draft at a matched hidden size by policy; the
  `draft_emb.shape == target_emb.shape` assert in `scripts/build_eagle3_safetensors.py` enforces
  it. The `MobilintEagle3DraftModelMixin` `hidden_states.shape[-1] != inputs_embeds.shape[-1]`
  branch (calling `MobilintEagle3FCProjector.project`) is legacy / future-experiment scaffolding,
  not evidence that unequal base/draft widths are supported — do not use it to justify relaxing
  the packaging assert.
- `transformers_mblt/utils/eagle3/tree_decoding.py::softmax_topk_cpu_torch`
  dispatches per call. Default `auto`: slice to the declared `TopKLogitsWarper`'s top-K first
  and apply the processor list on that slice (Hugging Face `_get_logits_warper` order
  Temperature → TopK → TopP makes the slice mathematically identical to full-vocab softmax
  while skipping the full-vocab `exp`), *except* when boundary ties push part of the active
  support outside the slice — HF's `TopKLogitsWarper` uses a strict-less-than filter and keeps
  every logit equal to the k-th threshold, while `torch.topk` drops tied entries at the
  boundary, so the slice path checks `(x >= threshold).sum(-1) > slice_size` and falls back to
  the full-vocab helper on any tie; otherwise fall back to the full-vocab path so a bare
  `TopPLogitsWarper` still determines its nucleus over the whole distribution. `full` forces
  the full-vocab path as a manual override. `sliced` is a deprecated back-compat mode that
  unconditionally renormalizes over a top-``max_return_k`` slice and emits a warning; retain
  it only for A/B reproducibility. Toggle at import through
  `MBLT_EAGLE3_SOFTMAX_TOPK_MODE=auto|full|sliced`, or programmatically through
  `set_softmax_topk_mode(...)`. The `max_return_k` argument (default `10`) is a return-slice
  size for downstream candidate matching, not the math slice. Keep `prepare_logits_processor`
  in HF order (RepetitionPenalty → Temperature → TopK → TopP) so the auto slice-by-TopK path
  stays HF-equivalent. The greedy path (`temperature<=1e-5`) never enters this function because
  `prepare_logits_processor` returns `None`.
- Keep the argmax-first shape in `evaluate_posterior` greedy: `argmax(logits)[safe_positions]`
  avoids materializing the `(n_cand, depth, vocab)` fancy-index slice.
- EAGLE-3 speculative-decode rows exposed by `transformers-mblt tps measure` are `accept_steps`,
  `tokens_sum`, `tokens_per_step` (= `drafts_avg + 1`, matching `accept_length + 1` in the
  reference `speculative_decoding/mxq_app/eagle3MXQ.py`), and `draft_accept_ratio`. Non-EAGLE-3
  pipelines omit these rows automatically. The schema lives in
  `transformers_mblt/cli/tps_table.py`; update it and the focused `tests/transformers/cli_tps`
  suites together.
- `tps measure` also exposes `--print-output` (prints the actually generated tokens for the last
  run, both preserving and stripping special tokens), mutually exclusive
  `--enable-thinking` / `--disable-thinking` (overrides the Qwen3 chat template
  `enable_thinking` flag), and `--temperature FLOAT` (`0.0` keeps greedy; `>0` enables
  `do_sample=True`). Chat templates apply to text prompts by default. `tps sweep` remains greedy
  so its numbers stay comparable.
- On EAGLE-3 pipelines, `_apply_eagle3_gen_kwargs` in
  `transformers_mblt/utils/benchmark_utils.py` strips `min_new_tokens` and
  `pad_token_id` and sets `eos_token_id=None`, so `generate` honors the real EOS from
  `config.json`. `--decode N` becomes an upper bound and the measured `num_decode` reflects the
  tokens actually produced. Non-speculative pipelines keep exact-`N` semantics.
- MXQ backends have known cross-process non-determinism. Reproduce and isolate with
  `scripts/probe_mxq_determinism.py`, `scripts/probe_generate_same_process.py`, and
  `scripts/probe_warmup_stabilization.py`. Warmup does not stabilize outputs across processes
  (verified by the warmup probe). For stable measurements, run same-process `--repeat N`.
- Note the definition drift versus the reference `speculative_decoding/mxq_app` implementation:
  `accept_length` there counts drafts accepted while `tokens_per_step` here counts
  `drafts + 1` (the forced base root token per step). Use `tokens_per_step` when comparing to
  paper-style acceptance numbers.

## Validate Proportionately

- Start with the narrowest test file or documented `-k` selection and use `-x` while iterating.
- Run `pytest tests/transformers --full-matrix` only for release or pre-merge matrix validation.
- Hardware, downloaded models, and external data may be unavailable. Run safe static or focused
  checks and report the limitation rather than broadening the test run.
