# transformers-mblt API Reference

**transformers-mblt** runs Mobilint pre-quantized generative AI models through Hugging Face's [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).
These models run on Mobilint's [ARIES](https://www.mobilint.com/aries) and [REGULUS](https://www.mobilint.com/regulus) NPU boards. Supported target-device identifiers are `aries-rb`, `regulus-ra`, `regulus-rb`, `regulus-ra-usb`, and `regulus-rb-usb`; a board is selected by the `target_device` value in the shipped `config.json` (see the [NPU settings](#npu-settings) section), and defaults to `aries-rb` when the config omits it. Each Mobilint model release on the Hub is compiled for a specific board — pick the repository whose name ends in the target-device suffix (for example `mobilint/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-regulus-rb-usb`) rather than overriding `target_device` on a repository compiled for a different board.

It provides a seamless experience for using `transformers` models with the same class/function interfaces. All of the auto classes in `transformers` can import our pre-quantized models (e.g., `mobilint/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct`) and download the required files from HuggingFace hub. It also supports a locally downloaded model directory, just like the original `transformers`.

## Installation

- Install **transformers-mblt** using pip. `transformers`, `mblt-npu-python`, and the Mobilint runtime
  (`mobilint-qb-runtime`) are installed as required dependencies:

```bash
pip install transformers-mblt
# Qwen3-ASR additionally needs the upstream qwen-asr package
pip install "transformers-mblt[qwen-asr]"
```

- If you want to install the latest version from source, clone the repository and install it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mobilint/transformers-mblt.git
cd transformers-mblt
pip install -e .
```

- `mblt-model-zoo` users get the same models through `mblt_model_zoo.hf_transformers`; see the
  [top-level README](../README.md#using-with-mblt-model-zoo) for the import path mapping.

### Transformers version support

- NPU execution (`MobilintCache`, `MobilintLayer`, and all Mobilint LLM/VLM backends) requires
  `transformers>=4.54.0`, which introduced `transformers.cache_utils.CacheLayerMixin` — the class
  `MobilintLayer` subclasses.
- The supported package range is currently `transformers>=4.54.0,<5.18.0`; Transformers 5.17 is
  the latest release line covered by the compatibility matrix. Newer releases require an explicit
  compatibility validation before they are added to the package range.
- GPU-only benchmark workflows (for example
  `benchmark/transformers/benchmark_text_generation_models.py sweep --original-models --device cuda:0`)
  can run against `transformers>=4.53,<4.54` via a compat shim in
  `transformers_mblt/utils/cache_utils.py` that supplies an empty
  `CacheLayerMixin` stub when the symbol is missing. The stub is import-time only:
  instantiating `MobilintCache`/`MobilintLayer` under it is not supported and will fail at
  runtime, so keep the older-transformers path constrained to non-NPU comparisons (for example,
  loading `mobilint/EXAONE-3.5-*` original modeling code that broke on transformers 4.54+).

## Quick Start Guide

**transformers-mblt** provides quantized models based on Transformers with the same interfaces. If the `transformers-mblt` package is installed, you can use auto classes from `transformers` such as `pipeline`, `AutoModel`, and `AutoTokenizer` with our models' ids. The following code snippet shows how to use the pre-trained model for inference with `pipeline`. Our models include proxy python codes to import needed config and model classes. When loading through these proxies, `trust_remote_code=True` must be passed to every `transformers` auto loader that touches the Hub (for example, `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(...)`, `AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(...)`, `AutoModel.from_pretrained(...)`, and `pipeline(...)`).

Alternatively, call `transformers_mblt.register()` once before loading. It registers every `mobilint-*` model type
with the Auto classes, so the models load from the installed package without executing Hub remote code:

```python
import transformers_mblt
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM

transformers_mblt.register()
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("mobilint/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct")
```

```python
from transformers import TextStreamer, pipeline, AutoTokenizer

model_path = "mobilint/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(
    model_path,
    revision="W8",
    trust_remote_code=True,
)

pipe = pipeline(
    "text-generation",
    model=model_path,
    streamer=TextStreamer(tokenizer=tokenizer, skip_prompt=False),
    trust_remote_code=True,
    revision="W8",
    model_kwargs={"embedding_weight": "/path/to/embedding.pt"},
    device="cpu",
)

pipe.generation_config.max_new_tokens = None

messages = [
    {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are a pirate chatbot who always responds in pirate speak!",
    },
    {"role": "user", "content": "Who are you?"},
]

outputs = pipe(
    messages,
    max_length=4096,
)
```

You can also use `AutoModel` or `AutoModelForCausalLM` for initializing models.

```python
from transformers import TextStreamer, AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_path = "mobilint/EXAONE-3.5-2.4B-Instruct"

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(
    model_path,
    revision="W8",
    trust_remote_code=True,
)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_path,
    trust_remote_code=True,
    revision="W8",
    embedding_weight="/path/to/embedding.pt",
).to("cpu")

messages = [
    {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are a pirate chatbot who always responds in pirate speak!",
    },
    {"role": "user", "content": "Who are you?"},
]

input_ids = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=True,
    add_generation_prompt=True,
    return_tensors="pt",
    return_dict=False,
)

streamer = TextStreamer(tokenizer)
outputs = model.generate(
    input_ids.to(model.device),
    max_new_tokens=2048,
    do_sample=True,
    streamer=streamer,
)
```

We also support the vision-language models associated with `AutoProcessor` and image format inputs.

```python
from transformers import TextStreamer, pipeline, AutoProcessor

model_name = "mobilint/Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct"

processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    trust_remote_code=True,
    revision="W8",
)
pipe = pipeline(
    "image-text-to-text",
    model=model_name,
    processor=processor,
    trust_remote_code=True,
    revision="W8",
    model_kwargs={"embedding_weight": "/path/to/embedding.pt"},
    device="cpu",
)
pipe.generation_config.max_new_tokens = None

messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "image",
                "image": "https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-VL/assets/demo.jpeg",
            },
            {"type": "text", "text": "Describe this image."},
        ],
    }
]

pipe(
    text=messages,
    generate_kwargs={
        "max_length": 4096,
        "streamer": TextStreamer(tokenizer=pipe.tokenizer, skip_prompt=False),
    },
)
```

Further usage examples can be found in the [tests](../tests/transformers) directory.

### Qwen3-VL release contract

> **Note:** `mobilint/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct` and `mobilint/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct-Batch16` are
> currently **unsupported**. Loading either under `qbruntime` 1.4.0 / `mblt_npu` 0.1.0 hits
> `NPU-only model output order mismatch` and access-violation-crashes at
> `qbruntime.Model.__init__::get_model_input_shape`. Use the 2B or 4B variants until the 8B
> repo ships an MXQ compatible with the current runtime; see the "Known limitations" section of
> [`CHANGELOG.md` 0.0.0](../CHANGELOG.md#000) for the full withdrawal note.

Qwen3-VL ships on Mobilint as one release per Hugging Face branch: the vision `*.mxq`, the text
`*.mxq`, `MobilintQwen3VLProcessor`, and `MobilintQwen3VLConfig` are compiled and calibrated
together. The release-level field in current artifacts is `is_dynamic`, exposed as a top-level
attribute on `MobilintQwen3VLConfig`. The compatibility alias `dynamic_vision` remains available
for older artifacts and callers:

- `is_dynamic=True` (dynamic-vision release): variable-resolution vision + per-image 2D RoPE
  in the text decoder. Supports single-image, per-prompt multi-image, and video inputs.
- `is_dynamic=False` (static-vision release): fixed vision-token count baked into the text
  decoder. Supports one image per prompt only. Batched single-image prompts (`[[img_1], [img_2], ...]`)
  are always allowed; video and per-prompt multi-image inputs are rejected.

`AutoProcessor.from_pretrained` reads `config.is_dynamic` from the shipped `config.json` and
mirrors it onto `MobilintQwen3VLProcessor` and its video processor. Older configs that only carry
`dynamic_vision` are accepted, so a caller does not normally have to touch either flag directly.

Passing a video input or more than one image per prompt to a static-vision release raises
`NotImplementedError` from `MobilintQwen3VLProcessor.__call__` with a message pointing at a
dynamic-vision release:

```python
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("mobilint/Qwen3-VL-...", trust_remote_code=True)

# Two image parts in a single chat message render to two ``<|image_pad|>``
# placeholders bound to the same prompt, which the static release rejects.
messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "image", "image": img_a},
            {"type": "image", "image": img_b},
            {"type": "text", "text": "Compare these two images."},
        ],
    }
]
processor.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    add_generation_prompt=True,
    tokenize=True,
    return_dict=True,
    return_tensors="pt",
)  # static release -> NotImplementedError from processor.__call__
```

Video decoding uses the `torchcodec` dependency installed with `pip install transformers-mblt`;
validate video inputs only against a dynamic-vision release.

The vision MXQ and text MXQ are a bundled release: a dynamic-vision vision MXQ produces per-image
RoPE tensors that only a paired dynamic text MXQ consumes, so pairing a dynamic vision MXQ with a
legacy static text MXQ (or vice versa) silently corrupts image-boundary information. If you
override one MXQ at load time, override both to a matching pair. `from_pretrained` reconciles the
two compiled signatures and raises `ValueError` from `MobilintQwen3VLModel._reconcile_dynamic_vision`
when they disagree; the message names both flags (`visual._uses_dynamic_vision`,
`language_model._uses_rope_input`) and both MXQ paths (`vision_mxq_path=`, `text_mxq_path=`).

When the paired override's signature differs from the shipped `config.dynamic_vision`,
resynchronize the processor with the loaded model so it adopts the reconciled flag:

```python
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True)
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    trust_remote_code=True,
    vision_mxq_path="/path/to/other/vision.mxq",
    text_mxq_path="/path/to/other/text.mxq",
)
processor.sync_dynamic_vision_from_model(model)
```

This is only needed for the paired-override case; the standard `from_pretrained` flow already
keeps the processor and model in lock-step.

#### Vision output order

The Qwen3-VL vision MXQ emits four tensors of identical shape — the merger and three deepstack
features. Their index-to-role mapping is a property of the compiled artifact (a recompile can
permute them) and cannot be detected at runtime, so it ships with the release rather than being
hardcoded. The shipped Mobilint encoders use
`(merger, deepstack0, deepstack1, deepstack2) = (0, 2, 3, 1)`, which is the default applied
when `config.json` omits `vision_output_order`.

To ship a recompiled encoder with a different mapping, add `vision_output_order` to the
`vision_config` block of `config.json`:

```json
{
  "vision_config": {
    "model_type": "mobilint-qwen3_vl",
    "vision_output_order": [3, 0, 1, 2]
  }
}
```

`from_pretrained` loads it from the same repo/revision as the vision MXQ automatically — no
sidecar files, no path resolution, no revision pinning. For local recompile iteration where
`config.json` is not being re-uploaded, `MBLT_VISION_OUTPUT_ORDER=3,0,1,2` (comma-separated
env var) wins over the config field. Resolution order:

1. `MBLT_VISION_OUTPUT_ORDER=3,0,1,2` — process-wide developer override.
2. `config.vision_output_order` — the release channel.
3. The hardcoded default `(0, 2, 3, 1)` — backward compatibility for repos whose
   `config.json` predates the field.

#### Text MXQ DeepStack input layouts

The Qwen3-VL text MXQ is compiled with rank-3 inputs; the DeepStack feed can be **bundled** into
one `(num_layers, -1, hidden)` tensor or **split** into one `(1, -1, hidden)` tensor per DeepStack
layer. `MobilintQwen3VLTextModel` detects the layout from the compiled variant handle's
`get_model_input_shape()` at load time (batch builds fuse tensors into a single
`get_input_buffer_info()` entry, so the buffer-info count would misreport as 1 — the variant
handle is authoritative).

Supported layouts (`max_batch_size == 1` unless noted):

| Signature | Inputs | Rope | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bundled static | `[inputs_embeds, deepstack]` | baked | 2B/4B W8 non-batch. MRoPE baked into the compiled decoder. |
| Bundled dynamic | `[inputs_embeds, deepstack, rope]` | external | Non-batch dynamic; rope threaded via `MobilintQwen3VLRotaryEmbedding`. |
| Split static | `[inputs_embeds, deepstack_0, deepstack_1, deepstack_2]` | baked | Non-batch static, one input per DeepStack layer. |
| Split dynamic | `[inputs_embeds, deepstack_0, deepstack_1, deepstack_2, rope]` | external | Dynamic split-per-layer + rope; supports non-batch and batch. |
| Batched bundled | `[inputs_embeds, rope, deepstack]` | external | `max_batch_size > 1` (e.g. bundled Batch16 W8). |
| Batched split dynamic | `[inputs_embeds, deepstack_0, deepstack_1, deepstack_2, rope]` | external | `max_batch_size > 1`; split-per-layer dynamic Batch16 layout. |

The non-batch and batched 3-input orders differ (`[inputs, deepstack, rope]` vs `[inputs, rope,
deepstack]`), while split dynamic batches use `[inputs, deepstack_0, deepstack_1, deepstack_2,
rope]`; each dispatch honors its compiled signature. Split-static batches remain unsupported. The
split-input classifier assumes the Qwen3-VL family's three DeepStack layers. On composite construction,
`MobilintQwen3VLModel.__init__` calls `_validate_split_deepstack_layout` to cross-check the split
input count against `config.vision_config.deepstack_visual_indexes`; a MXQ/config layer-count
disagreement raises a legible `ValueError` at load rather than surfacing later as a downstream
`qbruntime` shape error. When a variant with a different DeepStack layer count ships, extend
`MobilintQwen3VLTextModel._BUNDLED_MXQ_INPUT_COUNTS`, `_SPLIT_MXQ_INPUT_COUNTS`, and
`_ROPE_MXQ_INPUT_COUNTS` in the same change.

Malformed values raise `ValueError` at the first vision inference from either source rather
than silently degrading output.

## Listing Available Models

**transformers-mblt** offers a function to list all available models. You can use the following code snippet to list the models for a specific task (e.g., `text-generation`, `automatic-speech-recognition`, etc.):

```python
from pprint import pprint
from transformers_mblt import list_models

available_models = list_models()
pprint(available_models)
```

The same listing is available from the CLI: `transformers-mblt list [--task text-generation] [--json]`.

It will search online to look up available models. When offline, it will list cached models in the current environment.

## Keyword Parameters

When loading models with `from_pretrained`, you can pass extra keyword parameters to customize runtime behavior.
For `pipeline(...)`, pass them via `model_kwargs={...}`.

### NPU settings

These are custom keyword parameters for Mobilint NPU execution (the compiled model is stored in an `*.mxq` file).

- `target_device` (`str`)

  Selects the Mobilint NPU board that the runtime opens. Supported values are `aries-rb`, `regulus-ra`, `regulus-rb`, `regulus-ra-usb`, and `regulus-rb-usb`; the legacy identifiers `aries` and `regulus` remain accepted and are normalized to `aries-rb` and `regulus-ra`. When omitted, the value ships with the model's `config.json`; loaders default to `aries-rb` if the config does not declare one. The board choice also constrains `core_mode` / `target_cores` / `target_clusters` (see below): every Regulus variant exposes a single cluster with a single core (`d:0:0`), so only `single` and `auto` core modes are valid and multi-core / cluster options apply to `aries-rb` only.

  Requires `mblt-npu-python>=0.1.0` (which pulls `mobilint-qb-runtime>=1.4.0`) for the USB variants and the board-aware runtime dispatch.

- `mxq_path` (`str`)

  Overrides which `*.mxq` file to load.
  You can pass either a local path or a path within the Hugging Face repository.
  Resolution order is:
  1) If `mxq_path` exists on disk (relative or absolute), it is used as-is.
  2) If `name_or_path` is a local directory, `os.path.join(name_or_path, mxq_path)` is tried.
  3) Otherwise, the loader tries to download `mxq_path` from the Hugging Face Hub (preferring the current `revision`), with fallbacks:
     - retry without `revision`
     - try to reuse a cached `*.mxq` from the local HF cache
     - finally, pick a best-effort `*.mxq` candidate from the repo if the exact path is not found

- `core_mode` (`str`)

  Selects how the NPU runtime schedules work across cores/clusters.
  Supported values:
  - `auto`: let qb Runtime select the core mode for each layer (for MXQs compiled with qb Compiler 1.3 or newer)
  - `single`: run on specific cores (use `target_cores`)
  - `multi`: run on one or more clusters (use `target_clusters`)
  - `global4`: global scheduling across 4 cores (use `target_clusters`)
  - `global8`: global scheduling across all cores (requires all clusters)

  Note: the effective/valid core mode depends on how the `*.mxq` was compiled. Some compiled models can reuse the same `*.mxq` file across `single`, `global4`, and `global8`, while newer MXQs can use `auto` to select among those modes per layer. `auto` requires qb Compiler 1.3 or newer and qb Runtime 1.4 or newer.
  For direct inference, a missing config value falls back to `auto`; benchmark entry points may use their documented suite-specific defaults. Regulus variants (`regulus-ra`, `regulus-rb`, `regulus-ra-usb`, `regulus-rb-usb`) expose only one cluster and one core, so only `single` and `auto` are valid on those boards; `multi`, `global4`, and `global8` apply to `aries-rb` only.

- `target_cores` (`list[str]`)

  Used only when `core_mode="single"`. Each entry must be in the form `"cluster:core"` on `aries-rb`, or `"0:0"` on every Regulus variant (single-core topology).
  - `cluster`: `0` or `1` on `aries-rb`; `0` on Regulus
  - `core`: `0`, `1`, `2`, or `3` on `aries-rb`; `0` on Regulus

  Example (Aries): `target_cores=["0:0", "0:1"]`
  Example (Regulus): `target_cores=["0:0"]`

- `target_clusters` (`list[int]`)

  Used when `core_mode` is `multi`, `global4`, or `global8`; therefore Aries-only.
  Each entry is a cluster index (`0` or `1`).
  - For `global8`, all clusters must be included (e.g. `target_clusters=[0, 1]`).

  Example: `target_clusters=[0]`

#### Prefixes for multi-backend models

Some architectures have multiple `mxq` files (e.g. encoder-decoder models, or vision-language models with separate text/vision backends). In that case, you can target a specific sub-module by prefixing the parameter name:

- Encoder/decoder prefixes:
  - `encoder_...` and `decoder_...` variants of the NPU settings above, e.g. `encoder_mxq_path`, `decoder_core_mode`, `encoder_target_cores`, `decoder_target_clusters`, etc.

- Text/vision prefixes:
  - `text_...` and `vision_...` variants of the NPU settings above, e.g. `text_mxq_path`, `vision_core_mode`, `text_target_cores`, `vision_target_clusters`, etc.

For example, you can override only the encoder `mxq` file:

```python
from transformers import AutoModel

model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(
    model_id,
    trust_remote_code=True,
    encoder_mxq_path="/path/to/encoder.mxq",
)
```

For vision-language models, you can override only the vision `mxq` file:

```python
from transformers import AutoModel

model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(
    model_id,
    trust_remote_code=True,
    vision_mxq_path="/path/to/vision.mxq",
)
```

#### revision

Our quantized models are uploaded on HuggingFace Hub.
The repositories on HuggingFace Hub work like a git repository, so they can have multiple branches.
We provide multiple quantized variants of a single original model via these branches (revisions).

We use the following revision labels for quantized variants:

- `W8`: all weights are quantized to INT8.
- `W4`: all weights are quantized to INT4.
- `W4V8`: in the attention QKV matrices, the Value (V) matrix is INT8, and the rest are INT4.

Currently, we only upload `W8` and `W4V8` variants.
The default `main` branch may differ by model (some models are fine with `W4V8`, others are not).
If you prefer inference speed over quality, use `W4V8`. If you need higher accuracy, use `W8`.

#### embedding_weight

If you have your own quantized model from our `qbcompiler`, you may have used rotated embedding options.
To make it easier to test custom compiled models, we support overriding the input embedding weights.

- `embedding_weight` (`str`)

  Path to a PyTorch checkpoint file loadable via `torch.load` (commonly `*.pt` or `*.pth`).
  The file can contain:
  - a `torch.Tensor` with shape `[vocab_size, hidden_size]`, or
  - a `dict` (e.g. `state_dict`) containing a `"weight"` entry, or (as a fallback) any single tensor value.

  The tensor must match the model's input-embedding shape exactly; otherwise, loading will fail.
  The weights are copied into `model.get_input_embeddings().weight` (device/dtype are preserved).

#### npu_prefill_chunk_size

- `npu_prefill_chunk_size` (`int`)

  Overrides the prefill chunk size used by Mobilint text-generation backends.
  If omitted or set to `None`, the runtime reads `npu_prefill_chunk_size` from the model's `config.json`
  using the current `core_mode` as the lookup key. For `core_mode="auto"`, older mappings without an
  `auto` entry reuse the tuned `single` value; an explicit `auto` entry takes precedence. If the config
  is missing or invalid, it falls back to `128`.

  EAGLE-3 models use the same field and the same resolution; the base and draft backends each look it
  up with their own `core_mode`, so one per-core-mode mapping can serve a `global4` base and a `single`
  draft. The former `eagle3_npu_chunk_size` field is no longer read.

#### EAGLE-3 tree settings

- `num_assistant_tokens`, `eagle3_tree_depth`, `eagle3_tree_top_k` (`int`)

  Draft-tree budget (tokens verified per round, root included; must be `>= 2`), expansion depth, and
  per-level fan-out (both `>= 1`); out-of-range values raise `ValueError`.
  Each `generate` call takes the explicit keyword argument first, then the same-named
  `generation_config.json` field. `eagle3_tree_depth` / `eagle3_tree_top_k` additionally fall back to
  the legacy `config.json` fields of older releases.

### EAGLE-3 generate compatibility policy

For Mobilint EAGLE-3 models, the draft backend is intentionally lightweight and
uses a single-block draft architecture (for example, a draft distilled from the
original model or a Llama-family 1-block draft), rather than the full base-model stack.

`MobilintEagle3GenerationMixin.generate(...)` follows an explicit compatibility policy for unsupported Hugging Face
generation options.

|Category|Arguments|Behavior|
|---|---|---|
|Ignored with warning|`attention_mask`, `min_new_tokens`, `pad_token_id`, `cache_position`, unknown `**kwargs`|The call continues and emits a warning message for each argument.|
|Hard error (`NotImplementedError`)|`num_beams != 1`, `assistant_model`, `use_cache=False`, custom `logits_processor`, `negative_prompt_ids`, `negative_prompt_attention_mask`|The call fails immediately to prevent ambiguous runtime behavior.|

Examples:

```python
# Warning-only path (continues)
outputs = model.generate(
    input_ids,
    attention_mask=mask,
    min_new_tokens=1,
)

# Hard-error path (fails fast)
outputs = model.generate(
    input_ids,
    num_beams=4,
)
```

### Original Keyword Parameters from `transformers`

The parameters below follow the standard `transformers` semantics. For Mobilint quantized `*.mxq` models, they only affect the non-NPU parts of the model (typically CPU-side layers such as embeddings). NPU execution always runs on Mobilint NPUs.

- `device`

    Sets the device for CPU-side layers.
    We recommend the default `cpu`, because `qbruntime` expects inputs from host memory. Moving CPU-side layers to GPU can introduce extra host↔device copies, so you should trade off compute speed vs. data transfer overhead.

- `device_map`

    Like `device`, but more granular: it assigns devices per submodule for CPU-side layers.
    It does not affect `*.mxq` execution, and we generally recommend not using it unless you have a specific reason.

- `trust_remote_code`

    Required when loading through the Hub proxy: the `auto_map` proxy code in each `mobilint/*` repository is loaded as remote code from the Hugging Face Hub.
    In that mode, pass it to every relevant loader call, including `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(...)`, `AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(...)`, `AutoConfig.from_pretrained(...)`, `AutoModel.from_pretrained(...)`, and `pipeline(...)`.
    This lets you use the standard `transformers` auto classes while loading Mobilint-specific implementations.

    Not required after `transformers_mblt.register()`: the `mobilint-*` model types then resolve to the installed package, so you can leave `trust_remote_code` unset (or `False`) and no Hub remote code runs. The `transformers-mblt` CLI accepts `--no-trust-remote-code` for the same path.

- `dtype`

    Sets the dtype (e.g. `float32`, `bfloat16`) for CPU-side layers.
    It does not affect `*.mxq` execution. We recommend leaving it as the default (inherited from the original model's `config.json`).

## Chat CLI

You can test out models with the `chat` command. `transformers-mblt chat` is delegated to the installed
Transformers CLI, while Mobilint model registration hooks are installed for local serve-based
Transformers backends when applicable. Supported chat options therefore follow the installed
`transformers` version.

```bash
transformers-mblt chat mobilint/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct --trust-remote-code
```

## TPS Benchmark CLI

You can run TPS benchmarks from the CLI.
The TPS CLI supports `--core-mode auto`, `--core-mode single`, `--core-mode global4`, and `--core-mode global8`. The
`--core-mode all` sweep alias is available in the benchmark scripts, not in the TPS CLI.

### Text-generation TPS

```bash
# repeated single measurement (prints mean/p50/p95/p99/min/max)
transformers-mblt tps measure --model mobilint/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct \
  --prefill 512 --decode 128 --repeat 10

# repeated sweep (writes aggregate curve + per-run payload)
transformers-mblt tps sweep --model mobilint/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct \
  --prefill-range 128:512:128 --cache-lengths 1024,2048,4096,8192 \
  --decode-window 128 \
  --repeat 5 --json tps.json --csv tps.csv --plot tps.png
```

### VLM synthetic sweep

`sweep --task image-text-to-text` measures:
- Vision encode latency (`vision_encode_ms`) and FPS (`vision_fps`) per image resolution
- LLM-phase total-prefill-length sweep and cache-length decode sweep at one reference resolution (`--llm-resolution`)

```bash
transformers-mblt tps sweep --model mobilint/Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct \
  --task image-text-to-text \
  --image-resolutions 224,384,512,768 \
  --llm-resolution 224 \
  --prefill-range 1024:4096:1024 \
  --cache-lengths 1024,2048,4096,8192 \
  --decode-window 128 --repeat 10 \
  --no-plot --json vlm_tps.json --csv vlm_tps.csv
```

Note:
- `sweep --task image-text-to-text` uses synthetic random image inputs.
- Some models/backends may enforce a fixed effective input size at runtime.

For TPS benchmark commands, you can use keyword parameters explained in [Keyword Parameters](#keyword-parameters).
CLI `tps sweep` and transformer benchmark `sweep` subcommands default to `--prefill-range 512:2048:512`, `--cache-lengths 128,512,1024,2048`,
`--decode-window 32`, and the CLI plot default is `tps_benchmark.png` when omitted.

## Tests And Benchmark Scripts

- Pytest-based functional tests: [tests/TEST.md](../tests/TEST.md)
  - The shared base `--core-mode` now defaults to `all`, so `pytest tests/transformers` sweeps `single`, `global4`, and `global8` for tests that use the base NPU backend.
  - Batch text-generation tests use the model config's `core_mode`, falling back to `auto` when it is absent. The shared default `--core-mode all` remains accepted there; fixed multi-core overrides are rejected.
  - Prefix-specific backends such as `vision_...`, `text_...`, `encoder_...`, and `decoder_...` are only swept when you explicitly pass options like `--vision-core-mode all`.
- Benchmark scripts: [benchmark/transformers/README.md](../benchmark/transformers/README.md)
  - Text-generation and VLM benchmarks default to `--core-mode global8`.
  - Passing `--core-mode all` benchmarks `single`, `global4`, and `global8`, and result filenames include the core-mode suffix.
  - When `--mxq-dir` is used, a single discovered `.mxq` target is reused across every selected core mode.
  - Text-generation and VLM benchmark scripts use `--prefill-range`, `--cache-lengths`, and `--decode-window` for sweep subcommands.
