      rendered string.
    * A batch of chat-message conversations (``list[list[dict]]``) — one
      count per conversation.

    Pre-tokenized shapes are nominal — upstream's ``__call__`` does not

        tensors that the text MXQ must consume via its rope input. This
        helper consults both compiled signatures and refuses to enable
        dynamic mode unless they agree.

        In the typical flow, ``dynamic_vision`` is populated automatically by
        :meth:`from_pretrained` reading the top-level ``config.dynamic_vision``

        unnecessary.

        Use it only when the processor and model have diverged at runtime —
        e.g. the model was loaded with an explicit ``vision_mxq_path=`` kwarg
        pointing at an MXQ whose signature (static/dynamic) doesn't match the

        the video processor's mirror) with the agreed value. Any prior value
        — the class default, a config-derived assignment from
        :meth:`from_pretrained`, or an explicit user override — is replaced.

        """Centralized safety gate for the processor's caller-kwargs surface.

        Every kwargs-surface invariant that the loaded release requires lives
        in this one method so a new class of "caller kwargs bypass safety"
        leak surfaces as a change here rather than as a scattered per-site
        patch. ``__call__`` invokes it exactly once, right after the incoming
        kwargs have been assembled and right before dispatch to
        ``super().__call__``. The invariants enforced (in order):

        1. **Structural knob equality.** ``patch_size`` /
           ``temporal_patch_size`` / ``merge_size`` are baked into the vision
           MXQ at compile time — the folded feature width the language model
           expects at the vision-language boundary is ``patch_size *
           merge_size`` and the temporal stride is ``temporal_patch_size``.
           Any override in the top-level or nested per-modality kwargs must
           match the shipped processor/config value; otherwise the boundary
           shape mismatches (or worse, silently reads plausible-but-wrong
           tokens). Run first because a smaller caller-supplied ``patch_size``
           would otherwise fool the vision-token budget clamp (whose ceiling
           is derived from the stored ``patch_size``).

        2. **Static branch resize rejection.** A static-vision release ships
           a vision MXQ compiled for a rigid ``(_NPU_H, _NPU_W, 6)`` grid;
           ``__call__`` pre-resizes every image to the matching pixel
           resolution via ``_resize_images``. Any caller-supplied ``size`` /
           ``min_pixels`` / ``max_pixels`` / ``do_resize=False`` would still
           reach upstream's ``_preprocess`` after that step and re-resize the
           just-normalized image away from the fixed grid. The video branch
           doesn't need a symmetric reject — it hard-fails at ``__call__``
           before the envelope runs on a static release — but the envelope
           still owns the story: it only clamps video kwargs on the dynamic
           branch and hands the reject to ``__call__`` for the static branch.

        3. **Dynamic vision resolution.** Dynamic images and video retain the
           full resolution requested by their release processors. Model Zoo
           does not impose an image- or video-token budget.

        4. **MRoPE metadata invariant.** tf 5.x's ``Qwen3VLModel.compute_3d_position_ids``
           and the generate-side ``_prepare_position_ids_for_generation``
           build MRoPE 3-D t/h/w positions only when ``mm_token_type_ids``
           is present in the tokenizer output. Without it, both fall back to
           linear (non-MRoPE) positions and the decoder cannot distinguish
           visual tokens by time/space — degenerate output on video, stale
           position math on multi-image. For a multimodal run on tf 5.x,
           force ``text_kwargs['return_mm_token_type_ids'] = True`` by
           explicit assignment (not ``setdefault``) so a caller-supplied
           ``False`` cannot silently disable MRoPE. Gate on
           ``create_mm_token_type_ids`` — the tf 5.x method absent on tf 4.x,
           where ``generate`` strictly rejects unknown ``model_kwargs`` and
           the field is a no-op the tokenizer would refuse.

        Release-level contract hard-fails (video-on-static, per-prompt
        multi-image-on-static) are *not* caller-kwargs invariants — they
        reject inputs the loaded release cannot serve at all — so they
        happen in ``__call__`` before this envelope runs. Dynamic image and
        video resize defaults and overrides are passed through unchanged.
